# Introduction to Python

Python is one of the most versatile and beginner-friendly programming languages in the world. Known for its readable syntax and vast ecosystem, Python powers everything from web applications to data science and AI.

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Created by Guido van Rossum, it supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## Basic Concepts

### 1. Variables and Data Types

```python showLineNumbers
# Variable declaration
name = "John"
age = 25
is_student = True

# Data types
string = "Hello World"    # String
number = 42              # Integer
float_num = 3.14        # Float
boolean = True          # Boolean
my_list = [1, 2, 3]     # List
my_dict = {             # Dictionary
    "name": "John",
    "age": 25
}
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)    # Tuple
my_set = {1, 2, 3}      # Set
```
